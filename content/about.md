***自我传播***，也就是自说自话。本站是我记录想法及学习笔记的平台，是我说悄悄话的“树洞”。互联网是一个开放的公共空间，我写的东西既是给自己看的，也是给别人看的，因此本站兼具“日记”和“传记”的功能。

<center>喜欢的电影台词</center>

- 人，如果没有梦想，那和咸鱼有什么区别？——《功夫足球》

- 心情不好的时候，那就上厕所，上完之后，面部狰狞的对着马桶说：“你给我吃屎吧你！”然后猛冲厕所！——《麦兜》

- 每个人都有失恋的时候，而每一次我失恋，我都会跑步，因为跑步可以将你身体里的水分蒸发掉，而让我不那么容易流泪，我怎么可以流泪呢？在阿May的心里，我可是个很酷的男人。——《重庆森林》

- 人生不能像做菜，把所有的料都准备好了才下锅。——《饮食男女》

- **Mathilda**: Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?

  ​			**Léon**: Always like this. ——*Léon: The Professional*

- **Christopher Gardner**: [after playing basket ball] Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right?

  ​			**Christopher**: All right.

  ​			**Christopher Gardner**: You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period.

- Like sunlight, sunset, we appear, we disappear. We are so important to some, but we are just passing through. ——*Before Midnight*

- The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning; is to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you will be dead. ——*BoJack Horseman*

- I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up.  ——*The Shawshank Redemption* 

- I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was. —— *Whiplash*

- All that city... You just couldn't see an end to it. The end! Please, could you show me where it ends? It was all very fine on that gangway and I was grand, too, in my overcoat. I cut quite a figure and I had no doubts about getting off. Guaranteed. That wasn't a problem. It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max. It was what I didn't see. Can you understand that? What I didn't see. In all that sprawling city, there was everything except an end. There was everything. But there wasn't an end. What I couldn't see was where all that came to an end. The end of the world. Take a piano. The keys begin, the keys end. **You know there are 88 of them and no-one can tell you differently. They are not infinite, you are infinite. And on those 88 keys the music that you can make is infinite.** I like that. That I can live by. But you get me up on that gangway and roll out a keyboard with millions of keys, and that's the truth, there's no end to them, that keyboard is infinite. But if that keyboard is infinite there's no music you can play. You're sitting on the wrong bench. That's God's piano. Christ, did you see the streets? There were thousands of them! How do you choose just one? One woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at, one way to die. All that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends. Aren't you scared of just breaking apart just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it? I was born on this ship. The world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time. And there were wishes here, but never more than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern. You played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite. I learned to live that way. Land is a ship too big for me. It's a woman too beautiful. It's a voyage too long. Perfume too strong. It's music I don't know how to make. I can't get off this ship. At best, I can step off my life. After all, it's as though I never existed. You're the exception, Max. You're the only one who knows that I'm here. You're a minority. You'd better get used to it. Forgive me, my friend. But I'm not getting off. ——*The Legend of 1900* 

<center>文学作品片段摘写</center>

- 我滚鞍下马，猛地把身体扑到青青的茂密的草丛之中，我悄悄地亲吻着这苦涩的草地，亲吻着这片留下了我和索米娅的斑斑足迹和炽热的爱情，这出现过我永远不忘美丽的红霞和伸展着我的亲人们生活的大草原。——《黑骏马》
- I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history.  ——*Moon and sixpence*

<center>我理想的工作环境</center>


我希望我有一个属于自己的书房/工作室，网络通畅、光线充足。



书房里有两张办公桌，或者一张足够长的办公桌，总之能摆得下多台显示器并且有多余的空间可以用来专注地看书。桌子上摆放着一些我喜欢的书和常用的工具书，摆放的显示器至少要有三个，一个竖屏的（看电子书和写代码超爽），一个超长屏的（看Endnote超爽），还有一台笔记本电脑。如果还有其它屏幕摆在一边就更好了，例如索尼DPT-RP1、微软surface、Macbook、Kindle。书房最好还有打印机和扫描仪，方便资料介质的转换。



书房的顶部还安有闭路电视（或者可以用树莓派做一个？），最好和房间大门通过物联网连接——开门自动开启，关门即关闭。



书房里还有一张蛋形座椅，可以用来休息，或是舒服地看一些闲书。书房还要有一台咖啡机，累的时候可以喝杯咖啡提提神。



书房里还有一个鱼缸，鱼缸里有鱼有虾有蟹有草，鱼缸配备过滤器、水草灯和自动投食器。
