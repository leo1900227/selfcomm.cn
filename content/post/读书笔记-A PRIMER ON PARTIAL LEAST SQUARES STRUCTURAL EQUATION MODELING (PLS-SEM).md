## What Is Structural Equation Modeling?

- 第二代统计技术

## Considerations in Using Structural Equation Modeling

1. **Composite Variables**

   `Composite value = w1 · x1 + w2 · x2 + … + w5 · x5`

2. **Measurement**

   - The logic of using several individual variables to measure an abstract concept such as restaurant satisfaction is that the measure will be more accurate.
   - *single-item constructs*  : While this is a good way to make the questionnaire shorter, it also reduces the quality of your measurement.  

3. **Measurement Scales**

   - *four types of measurement scales* :nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio 

4. **Coding**

5. **Data Distributions**

### Data Characteristics

- ***10 times rule*** : the minimum sample size should be 10 times the maximum number of arrowheads pointing at a latent variable anywhere in the PLS path model. 
- *statistical power analyses* : [G*Power](http://www.gpower.hhu.de/ )  

### Model Characteristics

- 数据不是正态分布也可以，但是极端值、强影响点、多重共线性问题还是要处理

- The PLS-SEM algorithm generally requires metric data on a ***ratio or interval scale for the measurement model indicators***. But the method also works well with ordinal scales with equidistant data points (i.e., quasi-metric scales; Sarstedt & Mooi, 2014) and with binary coded data. The use of binary coded data is often a means of including categorical control variables or moderators in PLS-SEM models. In short, ***dummy-coded indicators*** can be included in PLS-SEM models but require special attention (see some note of caution by Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, et al., 2012) and ***should not be used as the ultimate dependent variable.***

## Summary

- **Understand the meaning of structural equation modeling (SEM) and its relationship to multivariate data analysis.** SEM is a second-generation multivariate data analysis method. Multivariate data analysis involves the application of statistical methods that simultaneously analyze multiple variables representing measurements associated with individuals, companies, events, activities, situations, and so forth. SEM is used to either explore or confirm theory. Exploratory modeling involves developing theory while confirmatory modeling tests theory. There are two types of SEM—one is covariance-based, and the other is variance-based. CB-SEM is used to confirm (or reject) theories. Variance-based structural equation modeling (i.e., PLS-SEM) is primarily used for exploratory research and the development of theories. 
- **Describe the basic considerations in applying multivariate data analysis.** Several considerations are necessary when applying multivariate analysis, including the following five elements: (1) composite variables, (2) measurement, (3) measurement scales, (4) coding, and (5) data distributions. A composite variable (also called variate) is a linear combination of several variables that are chosen based on the research problem at hand. Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to a variable based on a set of rules. Multivariate measurement involves using several variables to indirectly measure a concept to improve measurement accuracy. The anticipated improved accuracy is based on the assumption that using several variables (indicators) to measure a single concept is more likely to represent all the different aspects of the concept and thereby result in a more valid measurement of the concept. The ability to identify measurement error using multivariate measurement also helps researchers obtain more accurate measurements. Measurement error is the difference between the true value of a variable and the value obtained by a measurement. A measurement scale is a tool with a predetermined number of closed-ended responses that can be used to obtain an answer to a question. There are four types of measurement scales: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. When researchers collect quantitative data using scales, the answers to the questions can be shown as a distribution across the available (predefined) response categories. The type of distribution must always be considered when working with SEM. 
- **Comprehend the basic concepts of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).** Path models are diagrams used to visually display the hypotheses and variable relationships that are examined when structural equation modeling is applied. Four basic elements must be understood when developing path models: (1) constructs, (2) measured variables, (3) relationships, and (4) error terms. Constructs are latent variables that are not directly measured and are sometimes called unobserved variables. They are represented in path models as circles or ovals. Measured variables are directly measured observations (raw data), generally referred to as either indicators or manifest variables, and are represented in path models as rectangles. Relationships represent hypotheses in path models and are shown as arrows that are single-headed, indicating a predictive/causal relationship. Error terms represent the unexplained variance when path models are estimated and are present for endogenousconstructs and reflectively measured indicators. Exogenous constructs and formative indicators do not have error terms. Path models also distinguish between the structural (inner) model and the measurement (outer) models. The role of theory is important when developing structural models. Theory is a set of systematically related hypotheses developed following the scientific method that can be used to explain and predict outcomes. Measurement theory specifies how the latent unobservable variables (constructs) are modeled. Latent variables can be modeled as either reflective or formative. Structural theory shows how the latent unobservable variables are related to each other. Latent variables are classified as either endogenous or exogenous. 
- **Explain the differences between covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and PLS-SEM and when to use each.** Compared to CB-SEM, PLS-SEM emphasizes prediction while simultaneously relaxing the demands regarding the data and specification of relationships. PLS-SEM maximizes the endogenous latent variables’ explained variance by estimating partial model relationships in an iterative sequence of OLS regressions. In contrast, CB-SEM follows a different measurement philosophy than does PLS-SEM, which calculates proxies to represent the latent variables of interest. In contrast, CB-SEM estimates model parameters so that the discrepancy between the estimated and sample covariance matrices is minimized. Instead of following a common factor model logic as CB-SEM does, PLS-SEM calculates composites of indicators that serve as proxies for the concpets under research. The method is not constrained by identification issues, even if the model becomes complex—a situation that typically restricts CB-SEM use—and does not require accounting for most distributional assumptions. Moreover, PLS-SEM can better handle formative measurement models and has advantages when sample sizes are relatively small. Researchers should consider the two SEM approaches as complementary and apply the SEM technique that best suits their research objective, data characteristics, and model setup

## Stage 4: Model Estimation and the PLS-SEM Algorithm

### How the Algorithm Works

![](http://bit.ly/2Syy72f)

- exogenous constructs ：$Y_{1}$, $Y_2$ (formative measures )
- endogenous construct: $Y_3$ (reflective measures )

- outer weights: $w_{11}, w_{12}, w_{23}, w_{24}$
- outer loadings: $l_{35},l_{36},l_{37} $
- The coefficient $p_{13}$ represents the relationship from $Y_1$ to $Y_3$, and $p_{23}$ represents the relationship from $Y_{2}$ to $Y_{3}$ 



All partial regression models are estimated by the PLS-SEM algorithm’s iterative procedures, which include ***two stages***. 

- In the first stage, the <u>construct scores</u> are estimated. 
- Then, in the second stage, the final estimates of the outer weights and loadings are calculated, as well as the structural model’s path coefficients and the resulting   $R^{2}$   values of the endogenous latent variables.



users with experience in the statistical software environment R can also draw on packages such as ==semPLS== (Monecke & Leisch, 2012) and ==plspm== (Sánchez, Trinchera, & Russolillo, 2015), which facilitate flexible analysis of PLS path models.

## Summary

- **Learn how the PLS-SEM algorithm functions.** The PLS-SEM algorithm uses the empirical data for the indicators and iteratively determines the construct scores, the path coefficients, indicator loadings and weights, and further statistics such as R2 values. Specifically, after determining the scores for every construct, the algorithm estimates all remaining unknown relationships in the PLS path model. The algorithm first obtains the measurement model results, which are the relationships between the constructs and their indicator variables. Then, the algorithm calculates the path coefficients, which are the relationships between the constructs in the structural model, along with the R2 values of endogenous constructs. All results are standardized, meaning that, for example, path coefficients can be compared with each other. 
- **Comprehend the options and parameter settings to run the algorithm.** To apply the PLSSEM algorithm, researchers need to specify several parameter settings. The decisions include selecting the structural model weighting scheme, initial values to start the PLS-SEM algorithm, the stop criterion, and the maximum number of iterations. The path weighting scheme maximizes the R2 values of the endogenous constructs, so that option should be selected. Finally, the initial values (e.g., +1) for the relationships in the measurement model, the stop criterion (a small number such as 1 · 10–7), and a sufficiently large maximum number of iterations (e.g., 300) should be selected. The PLS-SEM algorithm runs until convergence is achieved or the maximum number of iterations has been reached. The resulting construct scores are then used to estimate all partial regression models in the structural model and the measurement models to obtain the final model estimates. 
- **Understand the statistical properties of the PLS-SEM method.** PLS-SEM is an OLS regression-based method, which implies that those statistical properties known from OLS also apply to PLS-SEM. PLS-SEM focuses on the prediction of a specific set of hypothesized relationships that maximizes the explained variance of the dependent variable. The initial key results of the PLS path model estimation are the construct scores. These scores are treated as perfect substitutes for the indicator variables in the measurement models and therefore use all the variance that can help explain the endogenous constructs. Moreover, they facilitate estimating all relationships in the PLS path model. The estimation of these relationships is, however, subject to what has been mistakenly referred to as the PLS-SEM bias, which means that measurement model results are usually overestimated while structural model results are usually underestimated compared with CB-SEM results. However, under conditions commonly encountered in research situations, this inconsistency is quite small. Moreover, the parameter estimation efficiency of PLS-SEM delivers high levels of statistical power compared with CBSEM. Consequently, PLS-SEM better identifies population relationships and is better suited for exploratory research purposes—a feature that is further supported by the method’s less restrictive requirements in terms of model setups, model complexity, and data characteristics. 
- **Explain how to interpret the results.** The PLS-SEM method estimates the standardized outer loadings, outer weights, and structural model path coefficients. The indicator loadings and indicator weights are computed for any measurement model in the PLS path model. When reflective measurement models are used, the researcher interprets the outer loadings, whereas outer weights are the primary criterion when formative measurement models are interpreted (note, however, that the loadings also play a role in formative measurement model assessment).For the structural model, the standardized coefficients of the relationships between the constructs are provided as well as the R2 values for the endogenous constructs. Other more advanced PLSSEM evaluation criteria used in assessing the results are introduced in Chapters 4 to 6. 
- **Apply the PLS-SEM algorithm using the SmartPLS 3 software.** The corporate reputation example and the empirical data available with this book enable you to apply the PLS-SEM algorithm using the SmartPLS 3 software. Selected menu options guide the user in choosing the algorithmic options and parameter settings required for running the PLS-SEM algorithm. The SmartPLS 3 results reports enable the user to check if the algorithm converged (i.e., the stop criterion was reached and not the maximum number of iterations) and to evaluate the initial results for the outer weights, outer loadings, structural model path coefficients, and R2 values. Additional diagnostic measures for more advanced analyses are discussed in later chapters.
